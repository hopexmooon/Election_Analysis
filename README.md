**Election-Audit Summary:**

This script can be used for future elections. We would need the new election data collected and stored in a csv file. We can also further analyze the current data and see if any county favored a specific candidate. This information could be used to predict future voting patterns for the next election. 

Another way the script could be used would be to analyze which county had the highest turnover rate. High turnover rates indicates the county has a higher impact in the popular vote. Future candidates could use this information to select which counties to advertise in.
